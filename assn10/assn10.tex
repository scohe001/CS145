  \begin{lemma}
    An edge $e$ is critical iff $f(e) = \text{cap}(e)$ in every maximum flow $f$.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{longFormProof}

    \begin{block}[B]
      {Consider any $s$-$t$ flow network $G$ and edge $e$.

      \lineacross }
      
      \step First we will prove that, if $f(e) \ne \text{cap}(e)$ in some maximum flow $f$, then $e$ is not critical.

      \smallskip 
      
      \begin{block}[B1]
        {Assume that there exists max-flow $f$ such that $f(e) \ne \text{cap}(e)$.}

        \step Let $\epsilon = \text{cap}(e) - f(e) > 0$.  (Using here that $f(e) \le \text{cap}(e)$ and $f(e)\ne\text{cap}(e)$.)

        \step Let $G'$ be the graph obtained by reducing the capacity of $e$ by $\epsilon$.

        \step Since the flow through $e$ in $G$ is less than or equal to the capacity of $e$ in $G'$, 
              the flow through $e$ in each graph can still be $f(e)$.

        \step That is, the maximum flow in $G'$ is the same as that in $G$.

        \step So $e$ is not critical.
      \end{block}

      \step[B2] By block~\ref{B1}, if $f(e) \ne \text{cap}(e)$ in some maximum flow $f$,
      then $e$ is not critical.

      \smallskip 

      \lineacross 

      \step Next we will prove that, if $f(e) = \text{cap}(e)$ in every maximum flow $f$, then $e$ is critical.

      \smallskip 
      
      \begin{block}[B3]
        {Assume there exists some $e$ such that in every max-flow $f$,  $f(e) = \text{cap}(e)$.}

        \step Let $\epsilon>0$. (Reducing the capacity of $e$ by any $\epsilon$ should reduce the max flow by the definition of ``critical'').

        \step Since in every maximum flow, $f(e) = \text{cap}(e)$, reducing the capacity 
              of $e$ by $\epsilon$ will reduce the maximum flow by $\epsilon$

        \step So $e$ is critical.
      \end{block}

      \step[B4] By block~\ref{B3}, if $f(e) \ne \text{cap}(e)$ in some maximum flow $f$,
      then $e$ is not critical.

      \smallskip

      \lineacross 
    
      \step By lines~\ref{B2} and~\ref{B4},
      $e$ is critical iff $f(e) = \text{cap}(e)$ in every maximum flow $f$ in $G$.
    \end{block}

    \step By block~\ref{B},
    for any edge $e$ in any flow network,
    $e$ is critical iff $f(e) = \text{cap}(e)$ in every max flow $f$ in $G$.
