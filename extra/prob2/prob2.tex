  \begin{theorem}[Tower of Hanoi]
      For every positive integer $N$ EVERY sequence of legal movements that moves $N$ discs from one peg to another has AT LEAST $2^N - 1$ moves.
  \end{theorem}

  \smallskip

  \begin{longFormProof}

    \step We can prove this by induction on N.  Consider the base case N=1.

    \step To move one disc to any other peg at minimum will take 1 move.
      
    \step That is, when $N = 1$, the theorem holds.

    \begin{block}[A]
      {Assume for induction that the theorem holds for moving some positive $k$ discs.}

      \step That is, moving $k$ discs takes at least $2^k - 1$ moves

      \step Call the starting post we're moving from $P_0$, call the goal post $P_1$ and the other post, $P_2$.

      \begin{block}[B]
        {Consider any legal sequence for moving $k+1$ discs from $P_0$ to $P_1$.}

        \step At some point during this sequence, we must move the bottom disc (the $k+1$ disc) to $P_1$.

        \step By the definition of the problem, we can only move the top disc of any stack, and we cannot place it on any smaller disc.

        \step Thus to move the $k+1$ disc to $P_1$, the other $k$ discs cannot be on top of it or on $P_1$.

        \step That is, to move the $k+1$ disc to $P_1$, we must first stack the other $k$ discs on a post that is not $P_1$ or the post the $k+1$ disc is on.

        \step By 4.1, moving the $k$ discs to another post will take at least $2^k-1$ moves.

        \step Moving the $k+1$ disc to the target post will take at least $1$ move.

        \step Moving the $k$ discs to the target post will take at least $2^k-1$ moves.

        \step Together, this sequence will take at least $2^k-1 + 2^k-1 + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1$ moves.

      \end{block}

      \step By block~\ref{B}, any legal sequence for moving $k+1$ discs from $P_0$ to $P_1$ will take at least $2^{k+1} - 1$.

      \step Thus, the theorem holds for $k+1$ discs.

    \end{block}

    \step By block~\ref{A} if the theorem holds for $k$ discs, then it also holds for $k+1$ discs for any positive $k$.

    \step By 3 and 5, the theorem holds.
