  \problem % problem 1

    Describe a polynomial-time reduction from Vertex Cover to Set Cover.
  Definition of Set Cover: The input is $⟨U,C,k⟩$ where U is a set, $C = \{S1,S2,...,Sm\}$ is a collection of subsets of U, and k is an integer. The output is ‘yes’ if there is a set cover in C of size k, and ‘no’ otherwise. A set cover is a collection C′ ⊆ C of sets in C such that the union of the sets in $C′$ is $U$. The size of $C′$ is the number of sets in $C′$.

  Given an instance $\encode{G=(V,E),k}$ of \prob{Vertex Cover},
  the reduction outputs the instance $\encode{U,C,k}$ of \prob{Set Cover},
  where $U$, $C$, and $k$ are defined as follows:

  \lineacross 

  Let $U = E$ be the set of edges in $G$;

  let $C_i$ be the number of edges touched by $V_i$, that is $C_i = \{e_{V_iV_j} | e_{V_iV_j} \in E\}$;
  
  Let $k$ be $k$ from the Vertex Cover problem.
  
  \lineacross 

  \medskip 
  Here is why the reduction can be computed in polynomial time:
  
  \lineacross 

  Constructing $C$ will require at worst a loop over the edge set for each vertex, resulting in $O(VE)$ time, which is polynomial.

  \lineacross 
  
  \medskip 
  Here is a proof that the reduction is correct.
  \begin{lemma}
    Given any instance $\encode{G,k}$ of \prob{Vertex Cover},
    let $\encode{U,C,k}$ be the instance of \prob{Set Cover} produced by the reduction.
    Then $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$
    if and only if there is a set $C' \subseteq C$ of size $k$ where $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{k} C'_i = U$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{longFormProof}
    \step First we show the ``only if'' direction.
    \begin{block}[1oi]
      {Assume that $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$.}
      \step Let $I$ be the vertex cover of size $k$ in $G$.
      \smallskip 

      \step Take $C'$ to be the set of sets in $C$ corresponding to the vertices in $I$.

      \step Then $C'$ has size $k$, and the union of all sets in $C'$ equal $U$
              because each set in $C'$, $C'_i$ corresponds to the edges touched by including vertex $V_i$.

      \smallskip 
      \step So there is a subset of size $k$ of $C$ such that the union over them all will equal $U$.
    \end{block} 
    \step Next we show the ``if'' direction.
    \begin{block}[1i]
      {Assume there is a set of at least $i$ ingredients that have total discord at most $p$.}
      \step Let $S$ be a set of at $i$ ingredients that have total discord at most $p$.  Note $i=k$ and $p=0$.
      \smallskip 

      \step Take $I$ to be the vertices corresponding to ingredients in $S$.

      \step Then $I$ has size $i$, and is an independent set because
      each pair $(i,j)$ of vertices in $I$ corresponds to a pair of ingredients
      with zero discord ($D_{ij}\le p=0$), so there is no edge $(i,j)$.

      \smallskip 
      \step There is an independent set of size $k=i$ in $G$. 
    \end{block} 
    \step By blocks~\ref{1oi} and~\ref{1i},
    $G$ has an independent set of size $k$
    if and only if there is a set of $i$ ingredients that have total discord at most $p$.

  % \problem % problem 2

  % Given an instance $\encode{G=(V,E)}$ of \prob{Directed Ham Cycle},
  % the reduction outputs the instance $\encode{G'=(V',E')}$ of \prob{Undirected Ham Cycle},
  % where $V'$ and $E'$ are defined as follows:

  % \lineacross 
  % For each vertex $v\in V$, add three \emph{clone} vertices $v^1, v^2, v^3$ to $V'$;
  % add edges $(v^1,v^2)$ and $(v^2, v^3)$ to $E'$.
  % For each edge $(u,w) \in E$, add edge $(w^3, v^1)$ to $E'$.
  % \lineacross 

  % \medskip 
  % Here is why the reduction can be computed in polynomial time:

  % \lineacross 
  % The reduction as described makes a single pass over the vertices and edges
  % of $G$ to build $G'$.  So it takes linear time.
  % \lineacross 

  % \medskip 
  % Here is a proof that the reduction is correct.
  % \begin{lemma}
  %   Given any instance $\encode{G=(V,E)}$ of \prob{Directed Ham Cycle},
  %   let $\encode{G'=(V',E')}$ be the instance of \prob{Undirected Ham Cycle} produced by the reduction.
  %   Then $G$ has a directed Hamiltonian cycle 
  %   if and only if $G'$ has an undirected Hamiltonian cycle.
  % \end{lemma}
  % \begin{longFormProof}
  %   \step First we show the ``only if'' direction.
  %   \begin{block}[2oi]
  %     {Assume that $G$ has a directed Hamiltonian cycle.}
  %     \step Let $C=(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n, v_1)$ be such a cycle.
  %     \smallskip 
      
  %     \step Obtain $C'$ from $C$ by replacing each vertex $v_i$ by its three clones $v^1, v^2, v^3$.

  %     \step So $C'=(v^1_1, v^2_1 v^3_1, v^1_2, v^2_2, v^3_2, \ldots, v^1_n,  v^2_n,  v^3_n,  v^1_1,  v^2_1,  v^3_1)$.

  %     \step Since $C$ is a Hamiltonian cycle, each edge $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ is present in $G$,
  %     and each vertex $v$ in $G$ is visited exactly once by $C$.

  %     \step So each edge $(v^3_i, v^1_{i+1})$ is present in $G'$ (by the reduction),
  %     and each vertex $v_i^\ell$ is visited exactly once by $C'$.

  %     \step Also, for each $i$, each edge $(v^1_i, v^2_i)$ and $(v^2_i, v^3_i)$ is present in $G'$ (by the reduction). 

  %     \step So $C'$ is a Hamiltonian cycle in $G'$.

  %     \smallskip 
  %   \end{block} 
  %   \step Next we show the ``if'' direction.
  %   \begin{block}[2i]
  %     {Assume that $G'$ has a undirected Hamiltonian cycle.}
  %     \step Let $C'$ be such a cycle.
  %     \smallskip 

  %     \step For each $v\in V$, the vertex $v^2$ has edges only to $v^1$ and $v^3$,
  %     so edges $(v^1, v^2)$ and $(v^2, v^3)$ are present in $C'$.
  %     Further, each $v^3$ has edges only to vertices $w^1$ such that $(v,w)\in E$.

  %     \step So (starting the cycle $C'$ at an arbitrary vertex $v^1$, and orienting it so that
  %     $v^2$ is the second vertex on the cycle), by a simple induction, the $3n$ vertices in $G'$ can be ordered so that

  %     \[C'=(v^1_1, v^2_1 v^3_1, v^1_2, v^2_2, v^3_2, \ldots, v^1_n,  v^2_n,  v^3_n,  v^1_1,  v^2_1,  v^3_1).\]

  %     \step Let $C=(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n, v_1)$ be obtained by replacing each clone triple $(v_i^1, v_i^2, v_i^3)$ in $V'$
  %     by its original vertex $v_i$ in $G$.
  %     So each vertex $v$ in $G$ is visited exactly once by $C$.

  %     \step Each edge $(v^3_i, v_{i+1}^1)$ is present in $G'$, so, by the reduction,
  %     each edge $(v_i, v_{i+1}$ is present in $G$.

  %     \step So $C$ is a Hamiltonian cycle in $G$.

  %     \smallskip 
  %   \end{block} 
  %   \step By blocks~\ref{2oi} and~\ref{2i},
  %   $G$ has a directed Hamiltonian cycle
  %   if and only if $G'$ has an undirected Hamiltonian cycle.

  % \problem % problem 3

  % Given an instance $\encode{G=(V,E)}$ of \prob{Directed Ham Cycle},
  % the reduction outputs the instance $\encode{\Phi}$ of \prob{SAT}, defined as follows:
  
  % \lineacross 

  % Let $n=|V|$.
  % The Boolean variables for the formula $\Phi$ are $X=\{x_{ij} : i\in V, j\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\}$,
  % with the interpretation that setting $x_{ij}$ to be true should correspond to having
  % a Hamiltonian cycle in $G$ with vertex $i$ at position $j$.

  % \newcommand{\one}{\mbox{\sf one}}
  % For any set of variables $S\subseteq X$, define $\one(S)$
  % to be the formula $(\bigvee_{x \in S} x) \wedge \neg (\bigvee_{x,x'\in S: x\ne x'} x \wedge \ x')$.
  % So $\one(S)$ is satisfied
  % if and only if exactly one of the variables in $S$ is assigned true.

  % Take $\Phi$ to be logical and of the following expressions:
  % \begin{enumerate}
  % \item For each vertex $i$, $\one(\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{in}\})$.
  %   (Each vertex should have one position.)

  % \item For each position $j$, $\one(\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{nj}\})$.
  %   (Each position should have one vertex.)

  % \item For each position $j$, and pair of vertices $i, i'$ such that $(i,i')\not\in E$,
  %   add clause $\neg (x_{ij} \wedge x_{i',j+1})$
  %   or, if $j=n$, then add clause  $\neg (x_{ij} \wedge x_{i',1})$.
  %   (In other words, vertex $i'$ cannot follow vertex $i$ on the cycle
  %   if there is no edge $(i,i')$).
  % \end{enumerate}
  
  % \lineacross 

  % \medskip 
  % Here is why the reduction can be computed in polynomial time:
  
  % \lineacross 
  
  % $\Phi$ can be built as described above in time $O(|V|^2 + |E|\,|V|)$
  % by appropriately enumerating the vertices $i\in V$ and positions $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
