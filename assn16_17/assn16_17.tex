  \problem % problem 2

  Given an instance $\encode{G=(V,E)}$ of \prob{Directed Ham Cycle},
  the reduction outputs the instance $\encode{G'=(V',E')}$ of \prob{Undirected Ham Cycle},
  where $V'$ and $E'$ are defined as follows:

  \lineacross 
  For each $v_i \in V$, construct a gizmo, ${v_i}^1, {v_i}^2, {v_i}^3$ to add to $V'$ and edges ${v_i}^1{v_i}^2$ and ${v_i}^2{v_i}^3$ to add to $E'$.

  Then for each $v_iv_j \in E$, construct edge ${v_i}^3{v_j}^1$ to add to $E'$.
  \lineacross 

  \medskip 
  Here is why the reduction can be computed in polynomial time:

  \lineacross 
  We need to create $3|V|$ nodes and $|E| + 2|V|$ edges to setup this graph. At worst this should be $O(|V| + |E|)$, which will be polynomial.
  \lineacross 

  \medskip 
  Here is a proof that the reduction is correct.
  \begin{lemma}
    Given any instance $\encode{G=(V,E)}$ of \prob{Directed Ham Cycle},
    let $\encode{G'=(V',E')}$ be the instance of \prob{Undirected Ham Cycle} produced by the reduction.
    Then $G$ has a directed Hamiltonian cycle 
    if and only if $G'$ has an undirected Hamiltonian cycle.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{longFormProof}
    \step First we show the ``only if'' direction.
    \begin{block}[2oi]
      {Assume that $G$ has a directed Hamiltonian cycle.}
      \step Let $C$ be such a cycle.

      \step That is, there is some order the vertices can be visited, $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n, v_1$ where all are unique except the first and last and all edge used are unique.

      \step Then $G'$ will have the Hamiltonian cycle, ${v_1}^1, {v_1}^2, {v_1}^3, {v_2}^1, {v_2}^2, {v_2}^3, ..., {v_n}^1, {v_n}^2, {v_n}^3, {v_1}^1$.

    \end{block} 
    \step Next we show the ``if'' direction.
    \begin{block}[2i]
      {Assume that $G'$ has an undirected Hamiltonian cycle.}
      \step Let $C'$ be such a cycle.

      \step Every ${v_i}^1, {v_i}^2, {v_i}^3$ gizmo must be visited either from 
            ${v_i}^1\rightarrow{v_i}^2\rightarrow{v_i}^3$ or ${v_i}^3\rightarrow{v_i}^2\rightarrow{v_i}^1$.

      \step The only way to move directly from one gizmo, $v_i$ to another, $v_j$ will be via the edge ${v_i}^3{v_j}^1$.

      \step Therefore, if one gizmo is visited $1\rightarrow2\rightarrow3$, they all will be and vice versa.

      \step Without loss of generality, we can assume $C'$ will be of the form ${v_1}^1, {v_1}^2, {v_1}^3, {v_2}^1, ..., {v_n}^3, {v_1}^1$ where every node is unique except the first and last.

      \step Therefore, $G$ will have a Hamiltonian cycle of the form $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n, v_1$.

    \end{block} 
    \step By blocks~\ref{2oi} and~\ref{2i},
    $G$ has a directed Hamiltonian cycle
    if and only if $G'$ has an undirected Hamiltonian cycle.
